# Playing With My Balls

A simple simulation of masses moving in space.  Represented as balls in the diagram.  Implemented in Haskell using [Yampa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa-0.14.6).  This is largely an experimentation test bed for learning functional reactive programming.  The goal is to show how to evolve multiple point masses with an initial position and velocity under the effects of simulated gravity.
